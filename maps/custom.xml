<!--
This is the Create Vehicle level file. It sets the size of the level, what environment to use and all objects, such as vox-models, scripts and boundary, used in the level.
Positions are given in meters relative to their parent objects position. If an object doesnt have a parent, it is in relation to the bottom center of the game world.
Sizes are given in voxels. One voxel is 0.1 meters on all sides.
In this scene the loaded vox file 'ground.vox' is made of several shapes in MagicaVoxel. When loaded in the game they are regarded as one vox. This opens up the possibility of building worlds larger than 256*256*256 voxels with MagicaVoxel. Observe that the individual shapes in the MagicaVoxel scene are all either smaller than the maximum shape size possible in MagicaVoxel or much thinner. This is because the physics in the game might stutter slightly when very large shapes are used.
Whats new in this scene compared to the basic and island scenes:
- On line 42 vehicles are introduced and explained.
- On line 75 lights is introduced and explained.
- On line 94 locations are introduced and explained.
- On line 110 wheels are introduced and explained.

<!-- 
The 'version' indicates what version of the editor was used to create the level. Leave it as is to make sure scripts are loaded as expected.
The 'shadowVolume' property sets the area of the game where lighting, and subsequently shadows, are calculated. It is expressed in meters; width, height, length
-->

	This sets the environment used for the level. 
	The 'template' property references a predefined setup of environments. Available environment templates are: 'sunny', 'night', 'sunset', 'sunrise', 'foggy', and 'rain'
	The 'skyboxrot' sets the rotation of the skybox around the y axis, affecting the direction of the sun light. Explicitly set properties like this overrides the properties in the template.

		A voxbox is a basic box shape. By default it is indestructible.
		The 'pos' property sets the position of the box's top-upper-left corner relative to the bottom center of the game world, in meters.
		The 'size' property sets the size of the box in voxels as; width, height, and length.
		The 'color' property sets the color of the voxbox with the values being the Red, Gren, and Blue components in the color, each in the range 0.0 - 1.0

		A vox is a voxel model loaded from a vox-file.
		The 'pos' property sets it's position relative to the bottom center of the game world, in meters. 
		The 'texure' property is used to apply one of the available textures. The first value, to the left of the space, is the index for the wanted texture. The textures can be found in the 'data/gfx/albedo.png' file in the installation folder. The top left white texture is number 0. The second value, to the right of the space, indicates how strong the texture should be applied in the range 0.0 - 1.0. 
		The 'file' property references the vox-file to be loaded. The 'LEVEL' keyword is a reference to the folder with the same name as the level file i.e., The keyword 'LEVEL' in the vehicle.xml level file (this file) references the folder named 'vehicle'.
